Job Board
=========

In response to some of the problems with the ATLRUG mailing list, I wanted to
give recruiters and job seekers a place to go for all things job related. This
will be a fairly simple job board without too many frills, focused on making it
easy for recruiters to post, and easy for members to find and respond to job
postings.

Feel free to create an issue to request a feature or assign one to yourself if
you just want to jump in and help out.
